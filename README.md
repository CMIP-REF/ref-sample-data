# CMIP Rapid Evaluation Framework Sample Data


<!--- --8<-- [start:description] -->

**Status**: This project is in active development. We expect to be ready for beta releases in Q2 2025.

The CMIP Rapid Evaluation Framework is a Python application that provides the ability to rapidly process and
evaluate CMIP data against a set of reference data.
This repository contains a set of sample data that can be used to test the REF.

CMIP REF is a community project, and we welcome contributions from anyone.
